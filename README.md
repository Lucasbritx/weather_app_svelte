# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## About the project
It's a simple weather project to the user see your location temperature or you can search around the world using the input component.

## Live project demo
https://weather-app-svelte-three.vercel.app/

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app you just need to push a new commit to this repo.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
